📍 Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern is a Behavioral design pattern.

📍 The chain of responsibility pattern is mostly used to pass the responsibility to the next if the current object cannot handle it at the moment. By utilizing this Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern, you can accomplish the loose coupling.

Let’s understand this design pattern with the below example:

Assume that you need to control a menu on the user level. There you have the CEO, Director, Manager, and the Executives. So accordingly each of them has multiple levels of permissions. So if you need to implement something based on these particular levels of permission, you could use this design pattern.

The best example for the chain of a responsibility design pattern that is implemented at the practical level is the Java API logger.
